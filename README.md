# C/C++ and Win32 wrappers
Simple wrappers for C/C++ and Win32 API (Windows API)

After many years of programming stuff, I'm tired of writing the same code over and over again.
I want to collect some of my codefiles here for easier access for myself and perhaps for others who might need them or can find them helpful.

I also started this because I had to go back and learn C and Win32 (Windows API) from the ground up, still learning.
After many years using C/C++, MFC, resource editors, and other classes/libraries I wanted to learn how it is all made from scratch, only using code and no resource editors, I want to know how to code it all from the beginning.
So I went back to basic, reading "old" C books like "C programming languange, Kernigan Ritchie", "C: The complete reference, Herbert Schildt", and old Win32 books like "Windows 2000 programming from the gound up, Herbert Schildt", "Programming Windows: The Definitive Guide To The Win32 Api, Charles Petzold", plus searching the web for old and legacy C and WinAPI code. Still looking for good old C and Win32 books.

My goal is to make things easier/faster to write C code especially WinAPI code (at least for myself), that's why I'm making wrapper functions.
Trying to stay away from C++ classes etc. to keep it all very simple. I don't have anything against C++ and classes, it's just that "raw" functions are easier for everyone to understand right away.

If anyone finds some of this useful that's great!
