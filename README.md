# C/C++ and Win32 wrappers
Simple wrappers for C/C++ and Win32 API (Windows API)

After many years of programming stuff, it's tiring to write the same code over and over again, and never ending up doing it in a uniform way.<br>
I want to collect some of my codefiles here for easier access for myself (for my pet projects) and perhaps for others who might need them or can find them helpful.
(Not that my code stuff is so great, special and genius, but why not share :))

I also started this because I had to go back and learn C and Win32 (Windows API) from the ground up, still learning.<br>
After many years of using C/C++, MFC, resource editors, other classes/libraries and shortcuts, I wanted to learn how it is all made from scratch, only using code and no resource editors if possible, I want to know how to code it all from the beginning.

So I went back to basic, reading old C books like: "C programming languange, Kernigan Ritchie", "C The complete reference 4.th.ed., Herbert Schildt", and old Win32 books like: "Windows 2000 programming from the gound up, Herbert Schildt", "Programming Windows: The Definitive Guide To The Win32 Api, Charles Petzold".<br>
Also searching the web for old and legacy, but still relevant, C and WinAPI code.<br>
And still looking for good old C, Win32 books and must reads of these topics.

My goal is to make things easier/faster to write C/C++ code especially WinAPI code (at least for myself), that's why I'm making wrapper functions.<br>
To keep it all very simple I'm not using C++ classes. I don't have anything against C++ classes, it's just that "raw" functions can be easier to understand right away, and they can easily be implemented in a C++ class, or in a namespace etc., if one wants to.

TLDR;<br>

If anyone finds some of this useful that's great! :)<br>
If not, that's ok, you're probably a better programmer than me, or found your own way to do these things, and that's cool :)
