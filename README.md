# C/C++ and Win32 wrappers
Simple wrappers for C/C++ and Win32 API (Windows API)

After many years I'm tired of writing the same code over and over again and "reinventing the wheel", feeling I never end up doing it in the same way. I now want to collect some of my codefiles here, making my own library sort of, for easier access and use.<br>

I had to go back and learn C and Win32 (Windows API) from the ground up, not using MFC and other shortcuts, I wanted to learn it all from scratch, using code as much as possible. My goal is to make things easier/faster to write C/C++ WinAPI code, at least for my own use.

TLDR;<br>

If anyone finds some of this useful that's great! :)<br>
If not, that's ok, you're probably a better programmer than me, or found your own way to do these things, and that's cool :)
