Wrappers for easier creating Windows API standard controls like static text, static lines, button, editbox and more..
Makes things easier when creating controls at run time, without resource files.
Written in C code for simplicity, not using C++ classes etc.
Hope this can help someone :)

TODO: Add more controls and wrappers. Also wrapper for Common controls eventually.
